// Has to conform to the protocols 'Encodable' in order to be saved into a plist.
// In order to be encodable, all of the data types WITHIN the custom class have to be standard data types

// Has to conform to 'Encodable' and 'Decodable'.
// We could write it: 'class Item: Encodable, Decodable'... however....
// Swift has combined those to be simply 'Codable'
